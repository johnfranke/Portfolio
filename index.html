            <h5 class="content-text">My name is John Franke. I'm currently attending the Kansas University coding bootcamp. I want to become a developer because it is something I've always been interested in. I self-taught myself html and css by playing around with it while I was in junior high, I got good enough to create websites for several people and small businesses. I now want to get into development as a career so now I am learning front end and back end to hopefully find a job in development.

                In my free time I enjoy spending time with my family and friends. I like to travel. The last place I visited was Buffalo, NY. While I was there I checked off a bucketlist item I've always had by visiting Niagara Falls. Other places I enjoy traveling to and I frequent quite often because of friends and just for fun are Chicago and Nashville. In the near future I would like to visit New York City.
